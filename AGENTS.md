# Homepage Work Rules

Follow the global user instructions first. These rules apply to this website repository.

## Incomplete Drafts

- When the user asks to put a homepage article, draft, or rough idea into `미완료`, create it under `content/<lang>/incomplete/`.
- Treat `미완료` as the owner's private draft shelf. Write the draft seriously and completely, but do not ask for a pre-publication review before committing.
- Use front matter with `hidden: true` and `reviewStatus: "none"` unless the user explicitly says otherwise.
- Fill the draft-list fields so the admin queue stays scannable when many drafts pile up: `title`, `date`, `draftSource` or `categories`, `subtitle`, `tags`, and `image` when a relevant existing image is available.
- After creating or updating a `미완료` draft, run the relevant Hugo build check, commit the scoped change, and push to `origin/main`.
- Do not move a `미완료` draft into a public section such as `column`, `career`, `apps`, `research`, `books`, or `literature` unless the user explicitly asks.
